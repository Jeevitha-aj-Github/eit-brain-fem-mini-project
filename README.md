This mini project is a small exploratory notebook for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in a simple 2D "head" model. 

So far it:
- draws a circular head boundary,
- places a set of electrodes on the boundary,
- defines a simple conductivity phantom with a high-conductivity inclusion.

The next step (work in progress) is to add a finite element solver and a small inverse step for recovering the inclusion conductivity from boundary measurements.
